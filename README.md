# Exploit Server
Similar to Portswigger's exploit server for rapid experimentation.
More limited in that malformed headers (headers starting with spaces) are removed by gunicorn and it is not as easy to modify the return type (e.g. 301/302 redirect).

Out of bands detection can be done by setting up another tool such as [https://interact.sh/](https://interact.sh/) as logs are not kept here.

# Configure host

```bash
# install dependencies
sudo apt update && sudo  apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y docker docker-compose

## Set config variables
**domain**

`services\nginx\user_conf.d\default.conf`

`services\nginx\nginx-certbot.env`

**set password**

## clone repository to server
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alecmaly/exploit-server.git
```

## Clear all containers and images
```bash
docker rm $(docker ps -a -f status=exited -q)
docker rmi $(docker images -a -q)

This is done automatically. Manual command to enter nginx container is listed below.
